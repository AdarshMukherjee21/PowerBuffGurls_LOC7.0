            <h2>What is CSR?</h2>
            <p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is the practice of businesses taking responsibility for their social and environmental impact. Originally, CSR was about philanthropy and charity, but today, it has evolved into a broader concept that includes ethical business practices, sustainability efforts, and community engagement. CSR is about companies being accountable not just to their shareholders, but also to society and the planet.</p>
